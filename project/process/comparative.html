            <p>Osmos is a game optimized for play on mobile and tablet platforms taking place in an “ambient world of physics-based gameplay and dreamlike visuals.” The game objective is to grow your own gaseous and glowing planet-like-object by absorbing other gaseous and glowing planet-like-objects, which must be smaller than yourself. Movement happens through ejection of matter behind you, so that you are propelled forward. This happens by tapping inversely to the direction you want to move. The game has an ambient electronic soundtrack that produces noises according to the actions happening on screen (planet movement, absorption, death, etc). Levels advance and each version is random, allowing for endless replay value. Upon opening the game, users are given little instruction on how to navigate the interface, requiring self-exploration. This is an aspect of interface design that I would like to implement in my own project. I want the user to be drawn into the simplicity of the site and feel comfortable navigating the different nooks and crannies of the page, and hear audible changes based on their behavior. And then I will steal Osmos’ users.</p>

            <p>Patterning is a “deep and flexible drum machine unlike any you’ve encountered before.” As personal music creation grows in interest among users, so does the need for simple and intuitive platforms that eliminate the need for years of training and high-skilled practice. Loading by default are classic drum machine samples, but there are also exclusive drum kits created and curated by current musicians and producers that complement other extensive and uncommon features. The graphics are visually appealing and playful, using a color palette that is warm and modern af. The relation of this product to my project is in the overlapping of user-selected sounds to create a new story with each session. It’s lit.</p>
