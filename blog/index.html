        Wow UC Davis has such a fun website! Check it out <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/">here</a>! It's super exciting because it's the school we all attend and it got some major rebrand job sometime last year. They changed everything from some dull colors (like only 3-4) and now it has a lot of color (thanks, gradient!) and some really lovely high-def drone videos. Life is more exciting when it can be captured on film.
