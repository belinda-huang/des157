            Wow UC Davis has such a fun website! Check it out <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/">here</a>! Sometime last year, our university decided to get a major rebranding job, which is really exciting because it is now young and hip and caters to students. The relevancy is extreme because this is the school we all attend. Big changes include a switch from a small pallet of 3-4 colors to a whole rainbow of gradients from gold to blue. The sections of the website are all spaced out very nicely, it is extremely user friendly and easy to navigate. There is a lovely high-definition video of student and campus life looping in the background, providing a humanistic familiarity. Life is so much more exciting when it can be captured on film. Thanks, drones! The site is responsive across multiple sized screens, and the close attention to details in interactivity (such as hover effects and highlighters) make the experience very fun and enjoyable.
